# Fruad_Detection

**Problem Statement**

It is important that credit card companies can recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that
customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
Machine learning algorithms become increasingly widespread in anomaly detection field. Both supervised and unsupervised algorithms depending on the application can be utilized to detect the anomaly action. In this work, we investigate both supervised and unsupervised algorithms for anomaly detection, build two algorithms (LOF and random forest) and test them on a real dataset associated with credit cards fraudulent transactions. Our results show that random forest (supervised) performance in terms of accuracy and F1 score is superior to that of LOF (unsupervised) algorithm.

**Dataset**
The data set is published at: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The datasets contain transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807
transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all
transactions. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.
